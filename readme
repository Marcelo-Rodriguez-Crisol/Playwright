I've decided to automate the following test cases:
PMT-01 - Guest user purchase
PMT-11 - Logged user purchase
PMT-04 - Expired CC Month/Year
These are critical to the business, and often the most important
With these we validate that both type of users are able to perform
purchases and that expired credit cards are not accepted to make
transactions.

I had to set up everything for the firs time since this is the 
first bit of automation I do ever. I found it very easy to create a basic cases 
and I have pushed through several issues I will be clearing up in the following 
days to better myself on this skill of automation
1. I had a few problems with the setup, chatgpt helped me with those errors
2. PMT-04 started failing but I didn't understand why. ChatGPT added a constant
with a page.locator as sweet.message for something that was a bit harder to find.
Didn't quite understand the fix, but I'll look into it.
3. I edited some of the code to expect the hypothetical CVV code for it to fail
4. Since this is my first time ever creating some scenarios for automation
I asked ChatGPT several of questions.

I was able to generate an automatic report and I am so hyped about this!
Thanks for the opportunity to learn and amazing skill! :D
